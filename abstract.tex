Contour is the shape or format of objects. Contours can be associated
to musical parameters such as pitch and time, representing one in
function of another. Contours help to give coherence to musical piece
and can be used to analyze and to compose music. Contour theories
provide many operations that demand precise mathematical calculation.
In this article we present the current state of \goiaba{}, a software
that assists musicians in contour related tasks such as the
calculation and plotting of operations, and a case study of a
composition where \goiaba{} was used to generate the contour-related
material.

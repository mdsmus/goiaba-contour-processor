\section{Musical Contour}

Contour is the shape or format of an object. In music one can speak of
a pitch contour, density contour, and so on. Contours can easily be
recognized from graphic representation by professionals and laymen
alike \cite{marvin88:generalized}. For instance, Beethoven's Fifth
Symphony's main motive and the corresponding pitch contour are
represented respectively in figures~\ref{fig:5a-sinfonia-motivo} and
\ref{fig:c-3120}.

Technically, a contour is an ordered set of numbered elements
\cite{morris93:directions}. Absolute values of contour elements are
ignored, and only the high-low relationship between them is regarded.
For instance, the music in figures~\ref{fig:5a-sinfonia-motivo} and
\ref{fig:ly-3120} have the same pitch contour, graphically represented
in figure~\ref{fig:c-3120}, and symbolically by F(3 1 2 0). Yet, both
passages sound completely different.

Contour theories
\cite{friedmann85:methodology,morris87:composition,marvin88:generalized,beard03:contour}
have been developed to organize the current knowledge about contour in
a systematic way. These theories were developed primarily as analytic
techniques for non-tonal compositions \cite{beard03:contour}, and
provide arrays, matrices and many operations to help the comparison of
contours, like inversion, translation, comparison matrix, and contour
interval array.

\section{The contour processing program Goiaba}

\goiaba{} is a program written in Common Lisp developed to process and
plot contours. It has many contour-related operations, like inversion,
retrogradation, rotation, contour reduction \cite{adams76:melodic},
contour class, contour adjacency series, contour adjacency series
vector, contour interval, contour interval array, contour class vector
I and II \cite{friedmann85:methodology}, and comparison matrix
\cite{morris93:directions}. Currently, \goiaba{} accepts and shows
contours in a numeric format, but it can also plot contours in a pdf
file.

\goiaba{} uses the Cl-pdf library
to plot contours, allowing easy visualization of contour operations.
For instance, the code in figure~\ref{fig:operations-code} generates a
graph with the original contour Z, 
\code{\#s(0 5 3 4 1 3)}, and its
retrogradation, inversion, and rotation. The result can be seen in
figure~\ref{fig:operacoes}.

\goiaba{} takes advantages of Common Lisp's multimethods capabilities.
In Common Lisp a method is actually a generic function that
specializes on the type of its arguments. For example, we have two
definitions for a generic function called \texttt{rotate}, one
specializes on the contour-with-duration object while the other on the
simple-contour object. The advantage of this approach is that we can
add more types of contour if necessary and write the appropriate
generic functions that will specialize on those types, without
disrupting the existing code.

\section{The application of Contour in composition}

Systematic studies about the usage of contour operations and
combinations in musical composition are scarce, despite the possible
coherence that contours can provide. For this reason we are
researching the usage of contour in composition and its advantages.
The first author of this paper, during his master's
\cite{sampaio08:em}, composed a woodwind quintet, based on contour
theories operations. 
This piece was composed entirely using \goiaba{} to simplify the
calculation of contour operations and plotting. The piece is based on
the contour P(5 3 4 1 2 0) and on combinations of contour operations
associated to parameters such as pitch, tempo, density and texture. In
figure \ref{fig:c-534120} we can see the original contour P and its
subsets and operations; retrogradation, inversion, rotation, and
interpolation.

\goiaba{} was used to compose a \eng{fugato} session in the quintet
because each part of the subject (fig.) \ref{fig:sujeito-fugato}) and
countersubject (fig.~\ref{fig:contra-sujeito-fugato}) were based on
different combinations of operations of rotation and retrogradation
(fig.~\ref{fig:output-sujeito-fugato} and
\ref{fig:output-contra-sujeito-fugato}).

\section{Conclusion and future work}

Contours help to give coherence to a musical piece, are easily
recognized graphically by musicians and laymen, and can be used to
analyze and compose music. Contour theories provide many operations
that demand precise mathematical calculations and graphical
representation, for this reason we are developing \goiaba{}, a contour
processing software that helps the calculation and plotting of contour
operations. \goiaba{} has been proven to be useful in composing music
that uses contour theory extensively. Currently \goiaba{} accepts only
input in a symbolic format, but we have plans to add support for
Lilypond, Kern, MIDI, ABC, and MusicXML formats as well. The next step
in our research is to improve \goiaba{} user interaction, releasing a
more friendly interface, possibly with a GUI.
